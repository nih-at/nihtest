.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm nihtest.conf
.Nd testing tool configuration file format
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Xr nihtest 1
is a testing tool.
It reads a configuration file to get its default settings.
The default path for the file is
.Pa nihtest.conf
in the current directory; this can be overridden with
.Xr nihtest 1 Ap s
.Fl C
flag.
This man page describes the format of this configuration file.
.Sh FILE FORMAT
The configuration file consists of multiple sections, which are started with
.Ar [ section-name ] .
The supported sections are
.Ic settings ,
.Ic environment ,
and
.Ic comparators .
.Pp
Each section consists of variable assignments in the format
.Ar name =
.Ar value ,
one per line.
.Pp
Multiple values for the same variable can be specified, one per line, where subsequent lines must be indented with spaces.
.Sh SETTINGS
In the
.Ic settings
section, the following variables are recognized:
.Bl -tag -width 20n
.It Ic default-program = Ar program
Test
.Ar program
if no
.Ic program
directive is found in the test.
.It Ic default-stderr-replace = Ar pattern replacement ...
Each line consists of two values,
.Ar pattern
is a regular expression and
.Ar replacement
the corresponding replacement string.
These are used for test cases without
.Ic stderr-replace
directives.
See
.Xr nihtest-case 5
for details on
.Ic stderr-replace .
.It Ic environment-clear = true
If
.Ic environment-clear
is set to
.Dv true ,
only variables explicitly set or passed through are included in the environment passed to the tested program.
.It Ic environment-passthrough = Ar variable ...
The named environment variables are passed through from the environment
.Xr nihtest 1
is run in to the environment passed to the tested program.
.It Ic environment-unset = Ar variable ...
The named environment variables are removed from the environment passed to the tested program.
.It Ic features-files = Ar file ...
Specifies the files to search for feature defines.
This is used in the
.Ic features
directive in test cases.
.It Ic keep-sandbox = Ar when
Describe when to keep the sandbox (i.e., not delete it) after running the test.
The following values are supported:
.Bl -tag -width 6n -compact -offset 8n
.It Dv never
Never keep the sandbox.
.It Dv failed
Keep the sandbox when the test failed.
.It Dv always
Always keep the sandbox.
.El
This can be overridden with the
.Xr nihtest 1
flags
.Fl Fl keep-broken = Ar when
or
.Fl Fl no-cleanup .
The default is
.Dv never .
.It Ic print-results = Ar when
Describe when to print the test results verbosely.
The following values are supported:
.Bl -tag -width 6n -compact -offset 8n
.It Dv never
Quiet mode.
.It Dv failed
Print details when the test failed.
.It Dv always
Verbose mode.
.El
This can be overridden with the
.Xr nihtest 1
flags
.Fl Fl quiet
or
.Fl Fl verbose .
The default is
.Dv failed .
.It Ic program-directories = Ar directory ...
Specifies the directories programs are searched for.
They are prepended to
.Ev PATH .
.It Ic sandbox-directories = Ar directory ...
Create sandboxes in
.Ar directory .
By default, the sandboxes will be created in the current directory.
A random directory of the pattern
.Pa sandbox_*
will be used.
.It Ic test-input-directories = Ar directory ...
.Xr nihtest 1
searches the current directory and
.Ar directory
for test cases, input and output files.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The
.Ic environment
section contains variable and values that will be added as environment variables when the test program is run.
.Sh COMPARATORS
The
.Ic comparators
section specifies programs to use to compare files of certain types.
The variable names have the format
.Ar got-extension . expected-extension ,
the value specifies the command line to use to compare these files.
The command will be run with the two files as arguments, the file in the sandbox first and the expected last.
.Pp
The command is expected to exit with code 0 if the two files are considered equal, any other exit code if not.
The command output will be displayed if verbose test results are enabled (see
.Ic print-results
above).
.Pp
For example, with comparators containing
.Dl zip.zip = zipcmp -v
and the test case containing
.Dl file got.zip expected.zip
the command
.Dl zipcmp -v got.zip expected.zip
will be run to compare the files.
